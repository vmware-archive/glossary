  Operations Manager is the installer for Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
  It is shipped to customers via Pivotal Network as a virtual machine appliance
  which includes a web UI for interactive use and a web service API for automation.
  Platform operators use Operations Manager to deploy a BOSH Director VM, to
  install, configure, deploy and upgrade tiles from Pivotal Network, to
  install and upgrade stemcells, and to generally manage their Pivotal Cloud
  Foundry installation. Operations Manager provides them a highly opinionated
  configuration of BOSH, automated creation and management of BOSH manifests,
  and automates the individual BOSH commands used to perform deploys.
  Authors of tiles, at both Pivotal and at partner organizations, use
  Operations Manager as a Software Development Kit for tiles, in the sense
  that Operations Manager defines how to write a tile and interprets the
  the tiles at runtime.
