The Service Broker API defines an HTTP interface between the services marketplace of a platform and service brokers.
The service broker is the component of the service that implements the Service Broker API, for which a platform's marketplace is a client. 
Service brokers are responsible for advertising a catalog of service offerings and service plans to the marketplace, and acting on requests from the marketplace for provisioning, binding, unbinding, and deprovisioning.

If you look at the Pivotal Application Service Apps Manager interface you will see some of the services listed like ElephantSQL - PostgresQL service
which is a service broker representing the service ElephantSQL for the Platform.
